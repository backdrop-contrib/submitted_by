Submitted By
============

Submitted By enables you to control the format of your content's "Submitted by"
information per content type. It adds fields to your node edit form that let you
enter tokenized patterns for the text you want to display.

Depends on [Token](https://github.com/backdrop-contrib/token) module.
Note: This module does not create any data; rather it relies on other modules
providing that data through Token.
